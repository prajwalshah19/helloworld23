# PVET

## This project takes user input on a landing page and uses OpenAI to generate four suggestions customized by their specifications. On each generated card, users can find a link that takes them to the generated suggestion on Google Maps. Each card also contains a brief description of the locations so users are well-informed before deciding where they want to go.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Installation

- **cd** into server folder
