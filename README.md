# PVET

## This project takes user input on a landing page and uses OpenAI to generate four suggestions customized by their specifications. On each generated card, users can find a link that takes them to the generated suggestion on Google Maps. Each card also contains a brief description of the locations so users are well-informed before deciding where they want to go.
